05/06/13: 	This portion of the assignment has been a considerable challenge. What appeared to be a simple task actually turned into a 4 hour project on how to pass a string back and forth through a C program. What I have done is set up a random_number() function to generate a random number between two set values. Both the inputChar() and inputString() functions use this function to genreate their random characters. In C, apparently integers can be simply cast to their ascii equivalent characters. What I did was look up the ascii values for certain integers and constrained the number generator to only produce values within the range of pertinent values. It should be noted that in a completely random sense, the testme() function has almost no chance of completing successfully. The constraints on the 'randomness' make it an extrememly low probability of ever producing the exact desired results. That being said, the program should, in a brute force manner, find the error eventually given enough computer time.
