This is a dominion project, written in the C language, that was given to us to develop various tests to find intentionally included logic and runtime errors in the project. The dominion game was not developed by me, but the various tests are my own code. The most code comprehensive test case is the file 'testdominion.c' which tests whole games of dominion.
